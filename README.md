# ?!

Lamescan - is a bruteforce tool for Radmin servers. Really useful thing. If you try to search for binaries or source code, you will find only hacked/pooped GUI version, because
- all links are dead
- all web pages are in Russian
- program is in Russian too
- you still can find GUI version, but not console
- GUI version is infected with some shit by coolhackers

Here you can find **original** source code and binaries and modified binaries.

# Modified?

The main issue of Lamescan was Russian. This language was not displayed correctly on some computers. Modified binaries of Lamescan marked with "mod". They were modified using Resourse Hacker and HxD.
